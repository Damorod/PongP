## Robot plays Pong 

###  Project 

My brother wanted to make a pong to have a robot play against the pc, so i made the game.>
The robot was a motor glued to an arcade stick with a camara attached to it, the camera would detect the color of the ball causing the motor to move the stick in the direction of the ball, therefore playing againt the pc.
We also wanted to have two robots play agains each other but we never finished the second bot.

It has a couple of flaws, more graphically than anything, for example the lines in the middle that "separate" each player looks weird on diferents tvs because i didnt make it generic.
